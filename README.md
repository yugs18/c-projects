## üßÖ Toralize ‚Äî Tunnel Any Linux App Through Tor (SOCKS4)

**Toralize** is a lightweight LD_PRELOAD-based tool that intercepts system network calls and redirects them through the **Tor network** using the **SOCKS4 protocol**.

It allows you to anonymize the network traffic of any Linux command-line application (like `curl`, `wget`, etc.) ‚Äî **without modifying their source code**.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

`toralize` hooks the `connect()` system call using `LD_PRELOAD`.  
When an application tries to connect to an IP/port, `toralize`:

1. Creates a new socket.
2. Connects it to the local Tor SOCKS proxy (default `127.0.0.1:9050`).
3. Sends a SOCKS4 request containing the target IP and port.
4. Forwards the application‚Äôs traffic through Tor.


### Example Ouput
```bash
$ toralize curl http://google.com

Connected to proxy successfully.
